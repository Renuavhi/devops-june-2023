# Day 2

## What is dual/multi booting?
- Using Boot Loader Utility, we should be able to support multiple OS in the Laptop/Desktop
- with Boot Loader Utility, only one OS can be active at a time
- Example:-
  - LILO
  - GRUB 

## What is Hypervisor?
- is Virtualization Technology
- helps us run multiple OS in the same Server/Workstation/Dekstop/Laptop etc.,
- the benefit is many OS can be active at the same time in the same machine
- for this to work, the Server/Workstation/Desktop/Laptop should have a Processor that supports Virtualization
- Intel Processor
  - Virtualization Feature is called VT-X
- AMD Processor
  - Virtualization Feature is called AMD-V
- there are two types of Hypervisors
  1. Type 1 ( Used in Servers/Workstations - Bare-metal without OS)
  2. Type 2 ( Used in Wokstations/Desktops/Laptors - with a Host OS )
